## Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

For this homework I was asked to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I had created in a past assignment -- specifically, plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, I had to create individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, a page to see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them. 

Included in this HTML assignment is a total of 7 HTML pages:
1. Landing Page
2. Comparison Page
3. Cloudiness Page
4. Humidty Page
5. Max Temperature Page
6. Wind Speed Page
7. Data Page

I used the cities.csv as my data set, converting to HTML using a Pandas conversion to HTML function. Using Jupyter NB, the code to convert the data is stored in data_conversion.ipynb and the outcome, or converted data, is stored in a file called raw_data.html. 

The final local file (file:///Users/saramclean1971/Desktop/WEBHW/uci-irv-data-pt-08-2020-u-c-master-02-Homework-11-Web-Instructions/02-Homework/11-Web/Instructions/index.html), showcases the final work project of all the coding pages. And this final HTML also showcases the results at https://saramclean17.github.io/index.html.
